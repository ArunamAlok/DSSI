In the knowledge-based and digital economy, the effective protection and management of
Intellectual Property rights, such as patents, is essential. 
Patent applications are techno-legally complex and require significant experience and expertise in order to assign
suitable classifications and determine its patentability during the examination process. 
WIPO,including other IP Offices, are exploring the use of AI/ML methods to assist practitioners
(Examiners/Patent Agents) in several usecases such as automatic patent classifications,
determining semantic similarity between key phrases from patent documents within the
patent’s contexts.
This project has selected the DWPI (Derwent World Patents Index) dataset containing e-waste
technologies related patent applications and grants from world’s patent issuing authorities.
This dataset (8867x91) is the basis for the WIPO patent landscape report with an objective to undertake
landscaping analysis of patenting and innovation activity related to e-waste technologies.
