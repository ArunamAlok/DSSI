In the knowledge-based and digital economy, the effective protection and management of
Intellectual Property rights, such as patents, is essential. 
Patent applications are techno-legally complex and require significant experience and expertise in order to assign
suitable classifications and determine its patentability during the examination process. 
WIPO,including other IP Offices, are exploring the use of AI/ML methods to assist practitioners
(Examiners/Patent Agents) in several usecases such as automatic patent classifications,
determining semantic similarity between key phrases from patent documents within the
patent’s contexts.
This project has selected the DWPI (Derwent World Patents Index) dataset containing e-waste
technologies related patent applications and grants from world’s patent issuing authorities.
This dataset (8867x91) is the basis for the WIPO patent landscape report with an objective to undertake
landscaping analysis of patenting and innovation activity related to e-waste technologies.

The sheer increase in the number of patents over years makes a case to facilitate patent
classification using AI/ML methods to assist the Patents Office efficiently manage patent
applications.The analysis looks into following questions: 
How to pre-process data for Patents ? Since its a technical document, how to do that using language models such as SciSpacy etc. How to decide the optimal number of topics that may exist and can be identified from the data?

An analysis of patent literature can reveal trends, technical details and relationships and shall
be helpful to guide investment decisions and policy regulations.

The objective is general exploration of the core inventive aspects of the patent application by
extracting information (title/abstract etc.).This is done using the natural language toolkit
(nltk) and topic modeling framework (gensim).
